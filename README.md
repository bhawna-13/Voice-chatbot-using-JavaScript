# Voice-chatbot-using-JavaScript
This project is build with Html, CSS, JavaScript.
I have used Web Speech API that are SpeechRecognition and SpeechSynthesis. The Web Speech API enables us to incorporate voice functionality easily into web applications.
We can access and adapt the different parameters of the speech request:
     text: It is used to specify the text of the speech.
     volume: It is used to control the volume where 1 is the maximum and 0 the minimum.
     rate: It is used to control the speed of the voice with 0.1 (lowest) and 10 (highest).
     pitch: It is used to control the pitch of the speech with 0 (lowest) and 2 (highest).
